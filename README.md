# 2024-Music-Consumption-Explicit-Clean
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between explicit content and song popularity across various streaming platforms in 2024. By using detailed data on song streams, playlist inclusion, and audience engagement metrics, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform trends in music consumption.


Key Research Questions

Does explicit content significantly affect a song's popularity or audience reach?
How do explicit and non-explicit songs perform across platforms like Spotify, Pandora, and SoundCloud?
Which platforms or engagement metrics (e.g., Shazam counts, playlist reach) are the most predictive of song popularity?
Are there identifiable differences in platform preferences for explicit vs. non-explicit tracks?
Data Overview

The dataset (complied by u/datatechworld) includes detailed metrics for songs streamed in 2024, such as:

Popularity indicators: Spotify Streams, AirPlay Spins, and YouTube Views
Explicit content marker: Binary indicator (1 = explicit, 0 = non-explicit).
Additional metadata: Track name, artist, album, release date, and genre.

Methodology

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Address missing values and ensure consistent data formatting.
Engineer new variables if necessary (e.g., grouping genres or normalizing popularity scores).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distribution of explicit vs. non-explicit tracks.
Compare key metrics (e.g., streams, playlist reach) for explicit and non-explicit songs.

Statistical Analysis:
Conduct t-tests or ANOVA to determine if explicit content has a statistically significant impact on popularity metrics.
Use correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables like Shazam counts and Spotify streams.

Predictive Modeling:
Build regression or classification models to predict track popularity based on explicit content, engagement metrics, and platform data.

Insights and Recommendations:
Summarize findings on how explicit content influences popularity.
Provide actionable insights for artists and record labels about the role of explicit content in reaching broader audiences.
Deliverables

Visualizations:
Interactive dashboards (e.g., Tableau) showcasing platform-specific performance of explicit vs. non-explicit songs.
Charts illustrating trends in playlist reach, Shazam counts, and platform streams.

Statistical Summary:
A concise report detailing the statistical significance of explicit content's impact on popularity.

Predictive Model:
A machine learning model (if applicable) to estimate song popularity based on dataset features.

Presentation:
A narrative summarizing the findings, supported by visuals and actionable recommendations.
Potential Applications

Artists: Optimize content strategies by understanding how explicit content impacts performance across platforms.
Record Labels: Develop targeted marketing strategies for explicit vs. non-explicit tracks.
Streaming Platforms: Identify trends to enhance playlist curation and user engagement.

Conclusion:
We can reject the hypothesis that songs containing explicit content receive a signficant difference in streams and overall popularity.
